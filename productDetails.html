						"This is a wonderful scent that never manages to be overwhelming, which is important if you don't want to offend others. It smells wonderful going on, it's really delicious to smell. It does lose steam during the day.so reapplication is probably necessary. Ironically when I come home and shower it kind of blooms under the hot water. Go figure. But the scent is very relaxing so it's ok. It's subtle, warm and alluring."

					<p><strong>It takes some warming up to but give it a chance</strong></p>

						" I purchased this product based solely on the description and reviews alone. This is my first Jo Malone experience. My friend wears Red Roses by Jo Malone, and I love that scent on her. So when purchasing, I just assumed this would be a richer and softer version of Red Roses. When it arrived, I was so excited, that I tried it on immediately and immediately hated it. 
					</p>
					<p class="padding-1em">
						To me it smelled like a cheap French perfume of the 80's. The kind you find at the dollar store. I was just about to package it back up for return, but based on the positive reviews I read, I decided to wait and try the scent a couple more times. I have now grown to love this scent and can't stop smelling my wrists on a minute-by-minute basis. The longer it sits on your skin, the richer, and more settled the scent becomes. Chocolate and velvet oud gives off a soft musky scent while, while the rose comes through subtly and with a little bit of spice bite at the end. "
